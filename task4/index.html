                    <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b> (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvableRamanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, "he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",and some recently proven but highly advanced results.

In 1916, Ramanujan published his paper titled “On certain arithmetical functions”. In the paper, Ramanujan investigated the properties of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. Though the theory of modular forms was not even developed then, he came up with three fundamental conjectures that served as a guiding force for its development

                        In mathematics, theta functions are special functions of several complex variables. German Mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi came up with several closely related theta functions known as Jacobi theta functions.

                    <li> <b>HIS MOCK MODULAR FORMS MAY UNLOCK THE SECRET OF BLACK HOLES:</b><br>
                        In a 1920 letter to Hardy, Ramanujan described several new functions that behaved differently from known theta functions, or modular forms, and yet closely mimicked them. These were the first ever examples of mock modular forms. More than 80 years later, in 2002, a description for these functions was provided by Sander Zwegers. Further, Ramanujan predicted that his mock modular forms corresponded to ordinary modular forms producing similar outputs for roots of 1. Ken Ono ultimately showed that a mock modular form could be computed just as Ramanujan predicted.
